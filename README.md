### ✨ My Mission: From Pixels to Insights

For 7 years, my world was pixels. With over **370 completed projects** and a **4.8-star rating**, I learned that every single detail matters in creating a cohesive picture. Today, I apply that same obsession with detail to the world of data.

I've swapped my briefings for the syntax of **SQL**, **Python**, and **R**, but my goal remains the same: **to create something clear, functional, and memorable.** I use my color palettes to transform raw data into visual narratives using **Tableau** and **Looker**, always guided by the principles of **UX/UI** and **Design Thinking** to ensure the message is not just seen, but truly understood.

### 🎨 My Tool Palette

* **Analysis & Programming**: `Python` `R` `SQL` `Git`
* **Visualization & Design**: `Tableau` `Looker Studio` `Figma`
* **Methodologies**: `Scrum` `Kanban` `Data Storytelling` `Design Thinking`
